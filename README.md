# PolygonMesh
**Toy** halfedge polygon mesh implementation. This is a *learning* project, to learn about the **Half-Edge** data structure representation of a Polygon mesh.
Don't use this for anything, as the API and all inner workings will undergo multiple heavy and breaking changes until I have something I am satisfied with
